## Lessons Learned

One lesson that I learned while creating my portfolio is that React does not have an equivalent to the "onTransitionStart" event. To animate the cards on my portfolio, I had to find a solution by creating a custom React hook that includes a dependency state called "transition end". I added an event listener with the original event "onTransitionEnd" from JavaScript to trigger the animation, which solved the problem and allowed me to achieve the desired effect.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
